# create project "website"
* `django-admin startproject website` (generates the base required files for any django project)
* (Note to self: to remember what files do, read names as if reading directory paths.)
* (Note to self: we're usually going to use website/settings.py and website/urls.py)
* Navigate to website folder so that you see manage.py and website folder.
* `python manage.py runserver`
  * You might have to do something like this beforehand: `export PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages`
* Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser.
* Hit Ctrl+c to stop the server.
